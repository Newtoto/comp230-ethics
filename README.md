## How programmer fatigued from crunch time can negatively impact a game development project.

<p>Crunch time in game development dramatically increases the working hours of its team members, resulting in fatigue and demotivation [1]. This paper will investigate the deeper impacts of these and the overall result on the final game release, such as a less effective agile process, and an increase in human error. The purpose of this is to gain a deeper insight into the costs of this common development practice.</p>
