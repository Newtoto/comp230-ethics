abstract={The games industry is notorious for its intense work ethics with uncompensated overtime and weekends at the office, also known as crunch or crunch time. Since crunch time is so common within the industry, is it possible that the benefits of crunch time outweigh the disadvantages? By studying postmortems and conducting interviews with employees in the industry, we aim to characterise crunch time and discover its effects on the industry. We provide a classification of crunch, i.e., four types of crunch which all have distinct characteristics and affect the product, employees and schedule in various ways. One of the crunch types stands out from the others by only having positive effects on product and schedule. A characteristic that all of the types have in common is an increase in stress levels amongst the employees. We identify a set of reasons for crunch and show that crunch is less pronounced in game studios where prioritisation of features is a regular practice.},

abstract={Mental fatigue reduces one's cognitive and physical abilities. In tasks requiring continuous attention, such as driving, fatigue is a well-known risk. However, when fatigued during daily tasks, such as programming, the nature of risk is more diffuse and accumulative, yet the consequences can be just as severe (e.g. defects in autopilot software). Identifying risks of fatigue in the context of programming can lead to interventions that prevent introduction of defects and introduce coping mechanisms. To character and predict these risks, we conducted two studies: a survey study in which we asked 311 software developers to rate the severity and frequency of their fatigue and to recall a recent experience of being fatigued while programming, and an observational study with 9 professional software developers to investigate the feasibility of predicting fatigue from interaction history. From the survey, we found that a majority of developers report severe (66%) and frequent (59%) issues with fatigue. Further, we categorized their experiences into seven effects on programming tasks, which include reduced motivation and reduced ability to handle tasks involving large mental workloads. From our observational study, our results found how several measures, such as focus duration, key press time, error rates, and increases in software quality warnings, may be applied for detecting fatigue levels. Together, these results aims to support developers and the industry for improving software quality and work conditions for software developers.},

Most current HRA studies concentrate on the influence of external context factors, such as working conditions, task time, etc., on human performance while ignoring internal psychological factors, for example, personality characteristics, feelings, motivations and so on. To explore both internal and external factors' impact on human reliability, we designed an experiment measuring the effects of work motivation, task difficulty on human error probability (HEP). 120 subjects participated in the experiment. The task difficulty levels in the experiment are much depends on the subjects' experience and training conditions. The results demonstrate that the general relationship between work motivation and HEP can be described by a U curve and the optimal work motivation is shifted with different task difficulty level, which also fit with Yerkes-Dodson Law.},

Emphasis has been given to eight methods most fully developed and most likely to be used by system engineers. Two general techniques are employed: analysis of historical data and computer-simulation of behavioral processes. No general purpose methodology is available; each method deals with some types of tasks and systems more efficiently than others. In general, simulation-based methods are more powerful than nonsimulation methods. Most methods output probability estimates of successful task/system performance and completion time, but are relatively insensitive to equipment design parameters, manpower selection and training needs. With only one exception no operability method utilizes a formal data base as input and in most cases the parameters these input data describe are not specifically indicated. For most methods validation and/or system application data are either lacking or incomplete.},

A discussion is presented of the requirement for different types of models for representing performance at the skill-, rule-, and knowledge-based levels, together with a review of the different levels in terms of signals, signs, and symbols. Particular attention is paid to the different possible ways of representing system properties which underlie knowledge-based performance and which can be characterised at several levels of abstraction-from the representation of physical form, through functional representation, to representation in terms of intention or purpose. Furthermore, the role of qualitative and quantitative models in the design and evaluation of interface systems is mentioned, and the need to consider such distinctions carefully is discussed.},

The discussion arises primarily based on the considerable theoretical vagueness and empirical inconclusiveness concerning this relationship that appears in the literature. As of interest to address this gap, a research framework is developed in which organizational commitment acts as the mediator between work motivation and job performance. The empirical findings from a survey of 220 bank frontline employees in Greece confirmed the mediating role of organizational commitment. The main implication of the findings for managers is that motivated frontline bank employees are more likely to achieve better job performance when they are committed, as a result of enforced HRM practices.},

abstract={With the fast improvement in technology, we are now moving toward exascale computing. Many experts predict that exascale computers will have millions of nodes, billions of threads of execution, hundreds of petabytes of inner memory and exabytes of persistent storage. For systems of such a scale, frequent failures are becoming a serious concern. One of the most important reasons is that in a large-scale system it is hard to detect failures. As a result, failure repair may take substantial time. In this paper, we investigate the effect of delayed repairing on two popular types of high-performance computing systems: IBM Blue Gene/P and general cluster. We analyze how delayed failure repairing will affect the performance of jobs when some computing units are at fault but not fixed in time. Our study is based on real workload traces and RAS logs collected from production supercomputing systems. Our Trace-based simulations indicate that fast failure detection and recovery is essential for moving towards petascale and beyond computing.},

In a pilot study of a software organization in India, we conducted interviews with 12 agile developers. Using descriptive statistical and thematic analysis, we identified three groups of factors motivating the self-assignment: task-based, developer-based, and opinion-based factors. We found that agile developers give precedence to task-based and developer-based factors over opinion-based factors. Furthermore, majority of the participants preferred to self-assign tasks that give them an opportunity to learn new technology, tools, and domains. This knowledge can be applied to let team members better select tasks of their interest and to conduct future studies into this topic.},
