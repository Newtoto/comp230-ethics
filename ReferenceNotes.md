## Crunch Time: The Reasons and Effects of Unpaid Overtime in the Games Industry
Recent research claims that crunch time itself can contribute to late deliveries and low quality software

Sleep deprivation can significantly reduce developers ability to make rational design decisions and produce high quality software
grave effect on the employee's personal relationships and mental health, causing many people to consider leaving the industry

At company A, 2 programmers were interviewed

From company A - programmers
workforce gets burnt out and that it becomes difficult to have a good work-life balance

it can affect peoples relationships in the way that “people's partners get very angry because suddenly their husbands or their wife isn't coming home at 5 o'clock, they're coming home at 8 and they're too tired to do anything.” 
He goes on saying that it also takes a physical and mental toll on you. 

“it makes people hate what they do”

According to our interviewee at Company B, crunch has a negative impact on software quality. She says that “you get sloppy because of the stress”.

Overworked and tired employees creating more bugs while bug fixing is also prominent for this type of crunch

They have been feeling extremely overworked, pressured, stressed, frustrated and exhausted

The teams morale has taken a toll while their bodies, relationships, and spiritual well-being have been neglected [13]–[14], [21]–[22]. It has also caused employees to forget the passion they once had for the game

Employees were sleep deprived [30], exhausted and burnt out by all-nighters and weekends at the office

Instead the projects ran late by up to five months.

We believe this is due to the fact that overworked and burnt out employees have a tendency of making more mistakes and thus create more bugs and reduce the quality.

employees neglecting their bodies in order to get a few extra hours of work every day

ince the employees associate their workplace with stress they will quickly regain the same stress levels once they get back to work. It is therefore suggested that recovery needs to happen daily in order to keep the staff's health and performance at good levels.

## Characterizing and Predicting Mental Fatigue during Programming Tasks

A culture has permeated the software industry that emphasizes performance over well-being. The expectation of long work-hours and participation in death marches [3], places developers in a situation where they must work in a state of fatigue (a physiological state of reduced mental or physical capability

Developers were fatigued due to poor sleep habits and the stress of working long and demanding hours. 

SURVEY
Performance: [28.42%] When I am tired I cannot come up with solutions as quickly, or sometimes not at all … Fatigued developers perform work slower. Suboptimal approaches and having less reasoning capabilities contribute to degradation of performance.

Focus: [20.64%] “When I am tired I find myself drifting from tasks that require a lot of focus (mental effort)”. Fatigued developers have reduced attention and increased absentmindedness. Respondents were concerned about being easily distracted and less productive. Impaired concentration leads to lack of regard for details, resulting in lower quality, and ability to stay on task.

Productivity: [19.03%] It harms my productivity. It also stifles creativity so you might not come up with the best solution the first time. The quality of my works declines drastically … ‘ Fatigued developers are less likely to produce code that satisfies a developers' intended goals and standards. Apart from poor reasoning, fatigue also affects quality and creativity. Responses also acknowledge an intersection between performance and productivity.

Errors: [10.72%] Introducing bugs into code, not deploying latest binaries and being surprised at lack of change in behavior. Tendency to cut corners, put things off and make mistakes … Fatigued developers make mistakes and reduce quality of code. Distraction and lack of focus is also contribute to increased chances for making logic errors and silly mistakes.

Mental Work-set: [7.77%] I cannot keep large coding context in my memory. I zone out all the time … When fatigued, a developer's mind looses the ability to focus on more complex tasks and ability to coordinate concurrent activities. Developers avoid complex tasks and focus on unnecessary trivial tasks.

Motivation: [7.77%] When I'm tired I lose all desire to continue with the task at hand which is upsetting. More resistant to starting new work, particularly if it seems ‘hard’ … Fatigue induces unwillingness to work. Responses acknowledged that without motivation to work, developers move towards delaying the work, in fact, they are often unwilling to even start.

Slower key movements, significant decrease in code quality - suggesting less quality control, less time spent focusing on a file, more copy pasting/refactoring when fatigued (easier tasks), overall decrease in amount of activity key usage mouse usage and time spend on software development.

## Measurement of Fatigue in Industries

Fatigue is caused by many kinds of factors in the workplaces. These are (1) overtime work (6) changes in work

the most common cause was mental and physical fatigue caused by how busy the work done is

To simplify the definition of fatigue, it is a state of being tired which is brought about by an excess of mental and physical work.

This state results in lowering or an impairment of human functioning. 

decreased enthusiasm for work as well as decreased efficiency in work. 

Industrial fatigue is caused by excessive workload, and it is dissipated or accumulates in relation to diurnal and nocturnal rhythms in life. 

Computer work causes mental fatigue, neck and upper limb disorders, low back pain,

persistent eye strain brought about by a high visual load, 

a lowering of the higher nervous activities, particularly the concentration of attention: the result is a lowering of the ability to think, causing thoughtlessness and a large number of errors, decrease in work efficiency, and a diminution in the amount of work.

## Shift work, safety and productivity

Fatigue impairs productivity and efficiency in shift workers over the course of a day.
