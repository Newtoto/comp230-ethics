## Crunch Time: The Reasons and Effects of Unpaid Overtime in the Games Industry (CrunchTime)
Recent research claims that crunch time itself can contribute to late deliveries and low quality software

Sleep deprivation can significantly reduce developers ability to make rational design decisions and produce high quality software
grave effect on the employee's personal relationships and mental health, causing many people to consider leaving the industry

At company A, 2 programmers were interviewed

From company A - programmers
workforce gets burnt out and that it becomes difficult to have a good work-life balance

it can affect peoples relationships in the way that “people's partners get very angry because suddenly their husbands or their wife isn't coming home at 5 o'clock, they're coming home at 8 and they're too tired to do anything.” 
He goes on saying that it also takes a physical and mental toll on you. 

“it makes people hate what they do”

According to our interviewee at Company B, crunch has a negative impact on software quality. She says that “you get sloppy because of the stress”.

Overworked and tired employees creating more bugs while bug fixing is also prominent for this type of crunch

They have been feeling extremely overworked, pressured, stressed, frustrated and exhausted

The teams morale has taken a toll while their bodies, relationships, and spiritual well-being have been neglected [13]–[14], [21]–[22]. It has also caused employees to forget the passion they once had for the game

Employees were sleep deprived [30], exhausted and burnt out by all-nighters and weekends at the office

Instead the projects ran late by up to five months.

We believe this is due to the fact that overworked and burnt out employees have a tendency of making more mistakes and thus create more bugs and reduce the quality.

employees neglecting their bodies in order to get a few extra hours of work every day

ince the employees associate their workplace with stress they will quickly regain the same stress levels once they get back to work. It is therefore suggested that recovery needs to happen daily in order to keep the staff's health and performance at good levels.

## Characterizing and Predicting Mental Fatigue during Programming Tasks (SoftwareFatigue)

A culture has permeated the software industry that emphasizes performance over well-being. The expectation of long work-hours and participation in death marches [3], places developers in a situation where they must work in a state of fatigue (a physiological state of reduced mental or physical capability

Developers were fatigued due to poor sleep habits and the stress of working long and demanding hours. 

SURVEY
Performance: [28.42%] When I am tired I cannot come up with solutions as quickly, or sometimes not at all … Fatigued developers perform work slower. Suboptimal approaches and having less reasoning capabilities contribute to degradation of performance.

Focus: [20.64%] “When I am tired I find myself drifting from tasks that require a lot of focus (mental effort)”. Fatigued developers have reduced attention and increased absentmindedness. Respondents were concerned about being easily distracted and less productive. Impaired concentration leads to lack of regard for details, resulting in lower quality, and ability to stay on task.

Productivity: [19.03%] It harms my productivity. It also stifles creativity so you might not come up with the best solution the first time. The quality of my works declines drastically … ‘ Fatigued developers are less likely to produce code that satisfies a developers' intended goals and standards. Apart from poor reasoning, fatigue also affects quality and creativity. Responses also acknowledge an intersection between performance and productivity.

Errors: [10.72%] Introducing bugs into code, not deploying latest binaries and being surprised at lack of change in behavior. Tendency to cut corners, put things off and make mistakes … Fatigued developers make mistakes and reduce quality of code. Distraction and lack of focus is also contribute to increased chances for making logic errors and silly mistakes.

Mental Work-set: [7.77%] I cannot keep large coding context in my memory. I zone out all the time … When fatigued, a developer's mind looses the ability to focus on more complex tasks and ability to coordinate concurrent activities. Developers avoid complex tasks and focus on unnecessary trivial tasks.

Motivation: [7.77%] When I'm tired I lose all desire to continue with the task at hand which is upsetting. More resistant to starting new work, particularly if it seems ‘hard’ … Fatigue induces unwillingness to work. Responses acknowledged that without motivation to work, developers move towards delaying the work, in fact, they are often unwilling to even start.

Slower key movements, significant decrease in code quality - suggesting less quality control, less time spent focusing on a file, more copy pasting/refactoring when fatigued (easier tasks), overall decrease in amount of activity key usage mouse usage and time spend on software development.

## Measurement of Fatigue in Industries (IndustryFatigue)

Fatigue is caused by many kinds of factors in the workplaces. These are (1) overtime work (6) changes in work

the most common cause was mental and physical fatigue caused by how busy the work done is

To simplify the definition of fatigue, it is a state of being tired which is brought about by an excess of mental and physical work.

This state results in lowering or an impairment of human functioning. 

decreased enthusiasm for work as well as decreased efficiency in work. 

Industrial fatigue is caused by excessive workload, and it is dissipated or accumulates in relation to diurnal and nocturnal rhythms in life. 

Computer work causes mental fatigue, neck and upper limb disorders, low back pain,

persistent eye strain brought about by a high visual load, 

a lowering of the higher nervous activities, particularly the concentration of attention: the result is a lowering of the ability to think, causing thoughtlessness and a large number of errors, decrease in work efficiency, and a diminution in the amount of work.

## Shift work, safety and productivity (ShiftWork)

Fatigue impairs productivity and efficiency in shift workers over the course of a day.

## Influence of work motivation and task difficulty on human reliability (HumanReliability)

psychological factors play an important role in human performance

experience and training would not only lower the task difficulty for subjects but also change the relationship between work motivation and HEP - super low motivation and super high motivation can both increase errors

## Work Motivations Affecting Self-Efficacy and Work Effectiveness of Flight Attendants of Airlines in Thailand (FlightAttendants)

Work motivation is related to self-efficacy and work effectiveness.

Airline business can motivate self-efficacy of flight attendants so as to increase work effectiveness.
food and water, clothing, shelter and medicines/healthcare

Employment contract is the factor having the highest score, so airline business can manage to motivate its flight attendants by offering clear, precise, fair and steady employment contract.

## Work motivation and job performance of frontline employees: The mediating role of organizational commitment (FrontlineEmployees)
Motivation is one of the top priorities which organisations should successfully deal with in order to tap on human capital and retain skilled and talented employees.

Thus, motivation may be used as a tool with which managers can tailor HRM practices, job assignments and rewards to enhance employees' commitment.

encourage employees' alignment to organisational goals in order to build high-performing employees by fulfilling or appealing to their needs 

## Evaluating Performance Impacts of Delayed Failure Repairing on Large-Scale Systems (LargeSystems)

 For systems of such a scale, frequent failures are becoming a serious concern
 
One of the most important reasons is that in a large-scale system it is hard to detect failures. As a result, failure repair may take substantial time

## Developers Motivation in Agile Teams (AgileMotivation)

We found that agile teams have Good Work/life balance (M9), considered as a motivator. 

Conversely, McHugh et al. [17] found that teams feel stressed due to the frenetic pace of agile work, having to always deliver every day and sometimes working overtime when the pressure is very intense. 

## Motivation for Self-Assignment: Factors Agile Software Developers Consider (EasyTasks)

Motivation is a critical determinant of project success in software projects

even if the developers are technically skilled to complete a task, they still may not self-select if it does not fall within their technical comfort zone. (Talk about easier tasks behing completed)
